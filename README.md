# Welcome

## What is Bottles?

Bottles is an application that allows you to easily manage wineprefixes on your favorite Linux distribution.

## Wineprefixes? Are you drunk?

No it's not about wine and Yes, we're drunk. We always are.

The wineprefixes are environments where it is possible to run Windows software thanks to Wine. Wine is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications.

In Bottles we call the wineprefixes, bottles. Because wine should theoretically be in bottles.
