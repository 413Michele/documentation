## What is Bottles?

Bottles is an application that allows you to easily manage wineprefixes on your favorite Linux distribution.

## Wineprefixes? Are you drunk?

No it's not about wine and Yes, we're drunk. We always are.

The wineprefixes are environments where it is possible to run Windows software thanks to Wine. [Wine](https://www.winehq.org) is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications.

In Bottles we call the wineprefixes, bottles. Because wine should theoretically be in bottles.

## Where to start?

Is simple. Start by [installing](getting-started/installation.md) Bottles on your Linux distribution.

## First run

At the first start you will be prompted to download a runner \(wine\) to be ready to create bottles.

Grab a drink and have a sit, Bottles will take care of everything.

Once the download is finished \(it will take a few minutes, it is about 60 ~ 70MB\), you can create your first bottle by pressing the "+" button on the top left.
