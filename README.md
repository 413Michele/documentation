## What is Bottles?

Bottles is an application that allows you to easily manage wineprefixes on your favorite Linux distribution.

## Wineprefixes? Are you drunk?

No it's not about wine and Yes, we're drunk. We always are.

The wineprefixes are environments where it is possible to run Windows software thanks to Wine. [Wine](https://www.winehq.org) is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications.

In Bottles we call the wineprefixes, bottles. Because wine should theoretically be in bottles.

## Where to start?

Is simple. Start by [installing](getting-started/installation.md) Bottles on your Linux distribution.

## First run

Already installed? Let's go with the [first boot](getting-started/first-run.md) of Bottles!
