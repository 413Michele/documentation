# First run

At the first start you will be shown the Onboard, which is a wizard that will explain some concepts and help you configure Bottles.

Once the key concepts of Bottles have been introduced, a runner \(~ 70MB\) will be downloaded, which is necessary for creating your bottles.

{% hint style="info" %}
We cannot offer these files with Bottles as these have different release cycles.
{% endhint %}

This is a one time operation, you can use the same runner for all your bottles or install others from the Bottles preferences.

Finally everything is ready and you can start using Bottles!

## Offline? You do not have time?

Are you offline or don't want to download it now? No problem.

If you are Offline, Bottles will notice and ask you to go online to proceed. All features that require a connection are blocked and will be active again as soon as you come back online!

You can go to the Bottles Preferences at any time and install a runner. Alternatively, when you create a bottle, you will be automatically taken to the installation page.

### Your first Bottle

When everything is ready, you will be faced with a screen like the following, telling you that there is no bottles yet.

To create your first bottle, you will need to press the plus button on the top left and proceed following the on-screen instructions.

Bottles uses an ad environments system for its bottles, I suggest you continue reading the next section for more information.
