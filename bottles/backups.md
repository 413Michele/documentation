# Backups & Duplicate

In Bottles you can export your bottles with ease and in multiple ways:

* Full backup
* Config backup
* Duplicate

### Backup types

The **full backup** make an archive with a full copy of your bottle directory \(comprehensive of configuration and files\) and let you store it wherever you want.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The full backup of a bottle includes all the personal files inside it. Be careful if you want to share it with other people or replicate it on computers that can be used by other people.
{% endhint %}

The **config backup** make a copy of your bottle configuration \(the `bottle.yml` file in the bottle root\), this can be provided to other users to replicate your bottle configuration or attached to a report when you are facing problems.

You can also **Duplicate** a bottle with a different name. This can also be used to create bottles with a  template, so make a new bottle with tweaked configuration and some dependencies, then duplicate to use the same environment in a new bottle.

### How to backup

To backup your bottle \(despite the backup type you choose\), just go to the bottle details view and press the dropdown at the top right of your bottle, then select the backup method you prefer.

### Import full backups

You can also import the full backup of a bottle, using our __**Importer** from the menu.
